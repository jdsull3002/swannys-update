    This massive bomber was built as an interim piece of hardware simply to fill a short term need <a href="B1B.html"><img alt="" src="../images/B1B/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="79"></a>
    while more stealthy aircraft were under development. Even so it is a
    fearsome weapon able to deliver a truly impressive weapons load over
    long distances and at supersonic speeds. Built only in limited numbers
    this heavy bomber is still active in US inventories and the model is
    nearly as impressive as the real thing. Check out this massive kit from
    Revell of the Rockwell <a href="B1B.html">B-1B Lancer</a>.

    The was the first American four engined jet to fly, it was the first operational jet bomber to be used by the US Air Force, <a href="B45.html"><img alt="" src="../images/B45/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="78"></a>
    the first jet aircraft to be refueled in the air and it was the first
    jet bomber to drop a nuclear weapon. On July 29, 1952, an RB-45C made
    the first non-stop Trans-Pacific flight, having been refueled twice by
    KB-29's along the way. Here Gary Buchanan takes us through the Mach-2
    1/72 kit of the <a href="B45.html">B-45 Tornado</a>. 8/25/07 <br>

    The supersonic B-58 Hustler derived from a concept developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s which took into account <a href="B58.html"><img alt="" src="../images/B58/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="80"></a>
    the greatly increased capability of ground defenses, including radar
    tracking and ground-to-air missiles. Among the many revolutionary
    advances embodied in the B-58 Hustler was the use of new procedures and
    materials in constructing the aircraft. Today there are only six B-58s
    left in existence. Issued in 1986 by Monogram and seeing a few
    subsequent reissues from Revell here is the 1/48 Convair <a href="B58.html">B-58 &#8220;Hustler&#8221;</a>.

    When Monogram released their B-58 Hustler in 1/48 they failed to open the aft crew compartments or provide <a href="../Aftermarket%20&%20Accesories/GDPR.html"><img alt="" src="../images/B58/GDPR/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="81"></a>
    any details for those areas. Not long after that Engines and Things
    came along with a somewhat crude detail package for this area and
    development of the kit seemed to stop there. Now, years later, a small
    cottage industry, Golden Dragons Productions has issued an extensive set
    to remedy this problem. Somewhat sporadic in their production of the
    set it is the best detail set to date for this old Monogram kit. Here is

    In the late spring of 2003 Revell of Germany re-issued the 1/48 scale B-58 Hustler. It seemed like a good idea to  <a href="B58Review.html"><img alt="" src="../images/B58pics/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="71"></a> review the detail kit that &quot;Engines and Things&quot; had produced a few years ago for the more daring modelers.<br>

    I like the s<a href="DH108.html"><img alt="" src="../images/DH108pics/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="78"></a>trange and unusual and I think this aircraft definitely fits
    the bill. Coming from the Bedfordshire area of the United Kingdom, from
    the mist enshrouded shop of ARBA Resins, this is the British version of the Bell X-1 trans-sonic
    research aircraft. The De Havilland 108 &#8220;Swallow&#8221;, high speed version.

    Design work on the Vampire series actually began in mid 1942. De Havilland utilized an egg shaped fuselage to house the <a href="../Aircraft/Vampire.html" align="left"><img src="../images/Vampire/thumb.jpg" name="Vampire" alt="Vampire" align="left" border="0"></a>
    Goblin engine and a twin boom structure to avoid interfering with hot
    exhaust gasses. The Vampire did not take flight until 1943 and the final
    production version was not test flown until 1945 so the type never saw
    active service during the Second World War. While many single seat
    fighters were produced and sold to a myriad of air forces three
    predominant two seat version were manufactured and here we can take a
    look at all of those kitted by Classic Airframes in 1/48. Here are the <a href="../Aircraft/Vampire.html">Vampire Two Seaters</a>. 6/15/08 <font color="#ff3300"> Construction complete 7/24/08</font><br>

    I am not generally a <em>Jet</em> person but the A6 Intruder and it&#8217;s electronic warfare cousin the EA-6B Prowler hold a  <a href="../Aircraft/EA6Breview.html"><img alt="" src="../images/Prowlerpics/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="83"></a>
    special place for me. I like these aircraft because they perform more
    in the realm of older subsonic aircraft that I usually build. This is
    Monogram&#8217;s reissue of the 1992 1/48 scale EA-6B Prowler. For a review of

    One highly sought after kit in the world of 1/48 aircraft modeling has always been the Revell-Monogram <a href="../Aftermarket%20&%20Accesories/EA6Bpit.html"><img alt="" src="../images/Prowlerpics/boxtop.jpg" width="66" align="left" border="0" height="80"></a>
    EA-6B Prowler and when this kit was put into production briefly in
    2003 it prompted several aftermarket companies to release various
    upgrade packages. Here I would like to show you the new and improved
    replacement cockpit from V.M.D Studios just released in May of 2005. I
    think this is a &#8220;must have&#8221; accessory for any Prowler build. Without
    further ado here is the Black Box <a href="../Aftermarket%20&%20Accesories/EA6Bpit.html">Prowler Resin Cockpit</a>, Combat series.

    In 1944 the Ministry of Aircraft Production was looking for a replacement for the DeHavilland Mosquito, <a href="Canberra.html"><img alt="" src="../images/Canberra/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="76"></a>
    The task of developing a replacement was sent to English Electric, a
    well established manufacturing concern with no actual aircraft
    experience. With &#8220;Teddy&#8221; Petted heading their design team they came up
    with a winning creation that ultimately served in over a dozen
    contemporary Air Forces in cluding the USAF and only was retired from
    the RAF in 2006. Lets take a look at the limited run Classic Airframes <a href="Canberra.html">E.E. Canberra B.2</a>.

    The idea that was to become the F-16 Fighting Falcon (Viper to its crews) began in the 1960s. <a href="../Aircraft/F16CJ.html"><img alt="" src="../images/F16CJ/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="68"></a>
    A group of individuals influenced by Colonel John Boyd known as the
    fighter mafia championed the development of a lightweight, high
    maneuverability fighter program which ultimately produced the F-16 in
    1976. Still in use and in production today this workhorse of a jet can
    be found in air forces around the world. In April of 2007 Tamiya
    released this 1/48 version of the block 50 aircraft which is to date
    probably the most accurate 1/48 scale model of this particular aircraft.
    Let&#8217;s take a look at this wonderful kit of the Lockheed Martin <a href="../Aircraft/F16CJ.html">F-16 C/J Block 50 &#8216;Viper&#8217;</a>. 4/6/07 <br>

    The F-22A Raptor built by Lockheed Martin in cooperation with Boeing represents the fifth generation of The United States air  <a href="../Aircraft/F22A.html"><img alt="" src="../images/F-22A/thumb1.gif" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="82"></a>
    superiority fighter. Not only is it an air superiority fighter but also
    fills several other mission functions including ground attack,
    electronic warfare and signals intelligence. The aircraft traces its
    origins back to 1981 when the Air Force first began to look for a
    replacement for the F-15 Eagle. From Academy this is the 1/48 <a href="../Aircraft/F22A.html">F-22A Raptor</a>. 1/23/2011 <font color="#ff3300">Construction complete 6/16/2011</font><br>

The F-84 designation was retained because it was thought that the F-84F would be a low cost improvement of the F-84 with around 55% parts commonality.

    The Air Force called it the Thunderchief but the crews called her &#8220;Thud&#8221; because that was the sound she made when she crashed. <a href="../Aircraft/F-105D.html"><img alt="" src="../images/F105Dhb/thumb.gif" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="77"></a>
    We've looked at this aircraft before in large scale, recently
    Trumpeter's little brother, Hobby Boss, released the kit in a downsized
    version. Based on the same drawings here is the smaller and slightly
    simplified 1/48 scale Hobby Boss <a href="../Aircraft/F-105D.html">F-105D Thunderchief</a>. 2/5/2011 <font color="#ff3300">Construction completed 2/24/2012</font></p>

    Designed in the late 1940s with an orthodox configuration, the IL-28 was the first jet bomber to enter service <a href="../Aircraft/IL28.html"><img alt="" src="../images/IL28/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="80"></a>
    with the Soviet air force. It was their equivalent to the British
    Canberra. This kit has gone through a strange evolution beginning with
    the original release by Bilek followed by a reissue from Italeri. This
    kit was rough to say the least but things really picked up when
    Trumpeter retooled the kit and issued it under their own banner. In 1/72
    here is the final evolution of this kit of the <a href="../Aircraft/IL28.html">Ilyushin IL-28 Beagle</a>. 5/13/05<br>
<br>

    The 1/72 scale IL-28 Beagle kit went through a strange path of evolution before it was a competent model kit <a href="../Aftermarket%20&%20Accesories/Pavla.html"><img alt="" src="../images/Pavla/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="73"></a>
    but the addition of some resin materials from a little Czech company
    called Pavla really makes for an outstanding model. This is not the only
    aftermarket set available for the IL-28 but it covers the most features
    that needed help on the kit be it from Bilek, Italeri or Trumpeter. For
    your consideration, from Pavla Models here is the <a href="../Aftermarket%20&%20Accesories/Pavla.html">IL-28 &#8220;Beagle&#8221;</a> resin detail kit.

    In 1950 Ilyushian engineers began design work for a close support aircraft whose pedigree obviously tracked back to the earlier <a href="../Aircraft/IL-40.html"><img alt="" src="../images/IL-40/thumb.gif" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="73"></a>
    IL-28 &#8216;Beagle&#8217; and IL-2 Shturmovik. After five years of teething
    problems and design modification the initial production run began only
    to be terminated almost immediately. The type never made it into
    operational service but did prove itself to be a nimble and potentially
    effective support aircraft before fading into the annals of aviation
    history. Here is the limited run 1/72 Amodel kit of the early <a href="../Aircraft/IL-40.html">Ilyushan IL-40</a> &#8216;Brawny&#8217;. 12/13/2010 <font color="#ff3300">Construction completed 1/1/2011</font><br>

    The design requirements for this aircraft grew out of the perceived needs for bomber escort fighters during <a href="../Aircraft/F101.html"><img alt="" src="../images/F101/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="71"></a>
    the last days of the Second World War. Originally designated the F-88
    Voodoo the aircraft experienced so many changes during development that
    it was re-designated the F-101 Voodoo. Even after the initial production
    run enough modifications were made that it should have been given an
    entirely new designation but ended up with a B suffix and went into
    service in the US and Canada as an Interceptor. Originally kitted in
    1985 let&#8217;s look at the current incarnation of Monogram&#8217;s 1/48 scale <a href="../Aircraft/F101.html">McDonnell F-101B &#8216;Voodoo&#8217;</a>. 8/4/07 <br>

    Some planes are marvels of technology while others are more the pilot&#8217;s machine &#8211; made for flying. The MiG-21 is one of those <a href="../Aircraft/MiG21.html"><img alt="" src="../images/MiG21/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="78"></a>
    in the pilot&#8217;s machine category. It did not have seriously advanced
    avionics or targeting acquisition but it was fast, Mach 2, agile and in
    the hands of a well trained pilot a very dangerous weapon. Easily
    maintained this is one of the most produced aircraft since the Second
    World War. Here we take a look at the 1/32 scale kit from Trumpeter that
    is relegating the old Revell kit to the back of the stash or to the
    E-Bay listings. Here is the large scale <a href="../Aircraft/MiG21.html">MiG-21 MF</a>. 12/16/06<br>

    During the 1950&#8217;s Northrop began an internally funded light fighter program with the intent to develop jet fighters capable <a href="../Aircraft/F5.html"><img alt="" src="../images/F5/thumb.gif" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="85"></a>
    of operating off of U.S. Navy escort carriers. While the U.S. Navy no
    longer had a demand for a light fighter there still existed a world
    market for the aircraft and the F-5A Freedom Fighter went into
    production for sale to U.S. Allies with 636 units manufactured. Several
    upgrades and variations of the type were produced and AFV Club is doing
    their best to give us all the late model <a href="../Aircraft/F5.html">Northrop F-5</a> aircraft and variants. 11/21/2010<br>

    The USAF called it the F-105 Thunderchief but the crews called it &#8220;Thud&#8221; because that was the sound it made when it crashed. <a href="../Aircraft/F105D.html"><img alt="" src="../images/F105D/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="63"></a>
    If that doesn&#8217;t inspire you to fly safe then I don&#8217;t know what will.
    Here you can take a look at the 1/32 offering from Trumpeter Models of
    the largest single engine fighter ever used by the USAF and the primary

    The Sukhoi Su-27 was designed specifically to combat the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle <a href="../Aircraft/Su27.html"><img alt="" src="../images/Su27/boxart1.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>
    As the F-15 program developed and the Russians learned more specifics
    of the aircraft their program saw continued modification to combat the
    American fighter&#8217;s capabilities. By time the aircraft entered service it
    was a formidable looking aircraft with amazing flight capabilities and
    is one of Russians premier multirole aircraft. From Academy this is the

While not as advanced in design as the A.V. Roe and Handley-Page proposals the Valiant was able to enter service by 1955 and this was what won it the primary contract.

    come. Things didn&#8217;t work out quite as planned but a lot of crucial
    information was discovered during the program&#8217;s life and this sleek
