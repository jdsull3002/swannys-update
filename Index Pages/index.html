            <h1>They're back!</h1>
            <p>I had wanted to have these sets ready for you back in mid-November
               but things happened. We had problems sourcing the crystal packs for the larger sets and then the
               production guy's wife had a baby right in the middle of the whole run and let me tell you childbirth can
               derail a program like nothing else. So please, accept my apologies for the tardiness of this release.
               What we have here for you are all the previously released DVD sets in hi-def with the addition of a
               4-volume set with a discount price. This is a limited release. I did not order enormous quantities of
               these DVDs so do not dilly-dally, once they are gone ..... That's it, nothing more until <I>maybe</I>
               next Christmas.</p>

            <p>Swanny's Models is proud to announce the release of the first in a series of instructional modeling
               DVDs. This DVD will take the modeler from the first parts preparation steps all the way through decaling
               and
               basic weathering. The primary purpose of this video is to assist the new modeler in achieving good
               results early. You can follow this link for more information on the video and ordering information.</p>

                Volume Two from Swanny's Models takes you through the complete process of building and detailing a resin
                aircraft cockpit. All steps are covered from initial washing to pour stub removal, painting and
                assembling a quality resin cockpit. Next the modeler goes through a similar process with a photo etched
                cockpit. Here the process of annealing the frets are covered along with how to remove parts without
                immediately losing them. Swanny shows you how to paint and assemble an acetate instrument panel and how
                to attach small PE detail pieces. In addition to all this the video set includes a bonus segment on
                working with vacuform canopies and there is more

                model parts, resin and photo etched parts are revisited and the process of achieving a realistic natural

    <h2>What this site is about:</h2>
    <div>
        <img src="../images/Dragonfly/cover1.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
        I remember the first model that I built. My father gave me a
        Revell submarine kit for my birthday in 1969. I clearly recall the two
        of us sitting at the dining room table with one of those orange tubes of
        Testors cement putting that thing together. It was an excellent bathtub
        toy for many years. Prior to that my older brother had entertained my
        sister and myself with aerial operas involving a 1/48 scale Monogram SBD
        Dauntless and a Monogram Corsair - I still have those two planes, dusty
        and worn but laden with memories that can never be replaced.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many times while shopping e-bay I've wondered what a particular
        kit consisted of or how good the detail of casting was or even if a
        particular kit had raised or recessed panel lines but could not answer
        these questions until I actually opened the box. While surfing various
        forums I would see common questions asked many times by modelers just
        beginning the polystyrene adventure, looking for clues to decaling,
        weathering and detailing. This site is dedicated to answering some of
        those questions. While I do not consider myself to be an exceptionally
        skilled modeler, I have picked up a few tricks over the last thirty
        years of modeling and will share them with you. Included here are full
        build reviews, in box kit reviews, construction tips and gallery photos
        of kits I have built. Most of these are 1/48th scale World War 2
        aircraft. Also included here are a variety of links to on-line modeling
        forums, review sites, internet hobby shops, aviation art sites and real
        aircraft reference sites.
    </p>

    <p>
        This site is a work in progress. I hope that you find it as
        enjoyable as I have.

    <p>During the Second
       World War design and development of new civilian cars and
       trucks was at a near complete standstill.
       Once the war ended resources could be devoted to these
       tasks. The 1947/8 model year Commodore from
       Hudson Motor Company introduced a 'step-down' which combined
       a uni-body floor pan structure with a
       recessed frame. This combined with a NASCAR style straight
       six grew into the Hudson Hornet which saw
       production for several years. Here we see the epitome of
       that production series,the <a HREF="../Aircraft/Hudson.html">1953 Hudson Hornet</a>. 4/29/2012</p>
