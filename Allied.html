 the A-20 arrived at a time of rapid growth and change in the late
1930&#8217;s as the world prepared for war. Here I look at the out of
production AMT 1/48 scale &#8220;G&#8221; model which was the final, heavily armed
version used extensively for ground attack. Here it is, the AMT <a href="Havoc.html">A-20G &quot;HAVOC&quot;</a> <br>

During the early years of the First World War the Germans held the advantage in the air with the infamous Fokker Scourge but in <a href="AircoDH2.html"><img alt="" src="images/AircoDH2/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="79"></a>
 1916 the tables began to turn due to the introduction of the Airco
DH-2. The DH-2 was of a pusher design which allowed for the weapons to
be mounted in front without concern for a propeller. The aircraft was
very maneuverable and relatively easy to fly but technological advances
only gave it about 8 months on the front line before becoming obsolete.
Here is the Eduard 1/48 release of the <a href="AircoDH2.html">Airco DH-2</a>.<br>

The Messerschmitt Bf-109 and the Heinkel He-111 both wreaked havoc over the cities of England during the  <a href="S199.html"><img alt="" src="images/S199/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="77"></a>
 Second World War but ironically these two fabled Axis combatants would
join in the most unusual manner to help the newly established Israeli
nation survive its tumultuous birth. Manufactured by Avia in
Czechoslovakia and sold to Israeli agents this problematic aircraft was
immediately put into combat. Difficult to handle on the ground and not
much better in the air it nonetheless provided the weapon dearly needed
to stave off Egyptian attack until something better could be acquired.

Originally intended as a small passenger aircraft and mail transport this twin engined aircraft was quickly <a href="Anson.html"><img alt="" src="images/Anson/thumb.jpg" width="218" align="left" border="0" height="76"></a>
 adapted for military service. Unfortunately the type was too slow and
too weakly armed to survive well in a combat environment. However this
did not hinder its ability to contribute to the war effort. Over 11,000
units were produced in Britain and Canada to perform as training
aircraft. Used to instruct navigators, bombers and gunnery crews she
continued in regular service until 1952. From Classic Airframes this is
the 1/48 <a href="Anson.html">Avro Anson Mk. 1</a> early version. 8/20/06<br>

1978 was the year, disco and polyester leisure suits were the rage and in the model shops appeared a box that fired the <a href="B17Ebuild.html"><img alt="" src="images/B17Epics/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="76"></a> imagination of generations. Revell had released their 1/48 scale B-17F <em>Memphis Belle</em>
 and the modeling world would never be the same. Often maligned for
raised panel lines and rivets it was and still is a sought after kit by
modelers around the world. For a preview of this classic kit, click
here&#8230;<a href="B17freview.html">B-17F Preview</a><br>
Lot's of B-17F models have been built, how about an &quot;E&quot; by Paragon?.... <a href="B17Econversion.html">B-17E Conversion</a><br>

It has been more than thirty years since two competing companies
released 1/48 scale models of the B-17 Flying Fortress. A lot has <a href="B17G.html"><img alt="" src="images/B17G/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="64"></a>
 happened over that time, nations have gone to war, companies have risen
 and fallen but the 1/48 scale B-17 has been there through it all. Some
changes were made and many accessories were turned out by aftermarket
suppliers and through it all the 1/48 B-17 had become an icon of a
modeling generation. Come with me on a journey through the <a href="B17G.html">History of the 1/48 B-17</a>. 5/27/06 <font color="#ff3300"> Updated 1/4/08 </font><br>

At first glance it looks like a B-17, just like all the rest flying over Europe in formation but as an enemy fighter <a href="YB40.html"><img alt="" src="images/YB40/thumb.gif" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="75"></a>
 moves in for the kill it suddenly becomes clear that this is no normal
B-17, this is a meat grinder. In 1942 Boeing converted 20 B-17Fs into
long range escort fighters with bomb bays filled to capacity with
ammunition and extra armor plate on the fuselage. While a good idea on
paper this never moved past the service test phase however I feel
compelled to build a 1/48 <a href="YB40.html">Boeing YB-40</a> Escort Fighter. 03/24/09 <font color="#ff3300">Construction Complete 06/14/2010</font><br>

I love building heavy bombers and jump at the chance to acquire any new kits or conversions when they become available. <a href="FordNose.html"><img alt="" src="images/B24fordnose/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="68"></a>
 In the summer of 2003 Cutting Edge Modelworks released their resin
conversion set for the 1/48 scale Monogram B-24J. This conversion allows
 the modeler to reproduce the distinctive &#8220;S&#8221; fairing on the nose and
accurately model alternative &#8220;J&#8221; aircraft along with the &#8220;H&#8221;, &#8220;L&#8221; and

With a design that was perhaps one of the sleekest shapes of the Second World War, the Martin Marauder <a href="B26B.html"><img alt="" src="images/B26/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="70"></a>
 rode out a stormy passage at the beginning of its career. With the
short wingspan some pilots quipped that she had &#8216;no visible means of
support&#8217; which ultimately resulted in the moniker &#8216;The Baltimore Whore&#8217;.
 Many of you may not be aware of the fact that this aircraft was modeled
 in 1/48 scale by two independent manufactures. It has been released
many times by Revell-Monogram but also by ESCI and here we will look at <em>both</em> kits. Here is a pair of <a href="B26B.html">B-26B Marauders</a> 4/3/04<br>

Late in 2002 I committed to build a B-29 for the 504/509 Bomb Group reunion in Annapolis for May 2003. Of course I <a href="DragonLady.html"><img alt="" src="images/B29/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="80"></a>
 forgot all about this until April 2003 when  they called me and asked
how that project was coming along. Of course I said &#8220;Just fine&#8221; and dug
into the kit with a passion that night. For gallery pictures and some

This little bi-fuel rocket fighter was designed in 1941 and once Stalin gave the project his approval it only took 35 days <a href="Bereznyak.html" align="left"><img src="images/Bereznyak/thumb.jpg" name="Bereznyak" alt="Bereznyak" align="left" border="0"></a>
to produce the first prototype. Seven of these hot little numbers were
manufactured but the type never came into production. Flight tested
until 1945 it was destined to become nothing more than a footnote in
rocket history. Let&#8217;s take a look at the only 1/48 kit of this Russian
project plane, the <a href="Bereznyak.html">Bereznyak-Ishaev B1</a> Rocket Interceptor from Sierra Scale. 12/10/05 <font color="#ff3300"> Construction Completed 8/27/06</font><br>

In 1936 the French Air Force went looking for a new fast bomber to update their inventory. Bloch Aircraft stepped <a href="Bloch174.html"><img alt="" src="images/Bloch174/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="58"></a>
 up to the plate with their three seat, twin engined Mb 174. Powered by
two Gnome-Rhone 14 cylinder radial engines and displaying exceptional
handling characteristics the aircraft was quite capable of taking care
of itself. Put into production just two years after the initial
prototype flew it was still in short supply by May of 1940 when the
German war machine rolled into France. This is the 1/48 scale resin kit
from Pend O&#8217;Rielle models of the <a href="Bloch174.html">Bloch Mb 174 A3</a> . 9/17/05<br>

By the time the Blenheim Mk V entered service in mid 1942 it was hopelessly underpowered <a href="Blenheim.html"><img alt="" src="images/Blenheim/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="80"></a>
 and outclassed compared to its adversaries in the Mediterranean and Far
 East theatres. It was originally built in England in 1934 as one of the
 first executive planes for the proprietor of the Daily Mail, Lord
Rothermere. At the time it was 30 mph faster than the RAF's new biplane
fighter, the Gloster Gauntlet. Bristol designed a military version of
their new aircraft, the Type 142M, which became the Blenheim Mk. 1. Here
 we look at the end result of that line of aircraft, from Classic
Airframes, the 1/48 scale multi-media <a href="Blenheim.html">Bristol Blenheim Mk. V</a>  12/24/04<br>

The P-40 Warhawk/Tomahawk/Kittyhawk family of fighters evolved from the Curtiss P-36 Hawk <a href="P40b.html"><img alt="" src="images/P40b/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="72"></a>
 series with a better engine and all round better performance. The
export equivalent of the P-40B was the Tomahawk IIA. They differed from
the American version by having the wing guns replaced by four 0.303-inch
 Brownings. The only American fighter aircraft built in larger numbers
than the P-40 were the P-47 Thunderbolt and P-51 Mustang. Let&#8217;s take a
look at the new 1/48 scale Trumpeter <a href="P40b.html">Curtiss P-40B &#8220;Warhawk&#8221;</a> 11/19/04<br>
<br>

America's foremost fighter in service when WWII began was the Curtiss-Wright P-40. As early reports of the war filtered back to <a href="P40E.html" align="left"><img src="images/P40E/thumb.jpg" name="P40E" alt="P40E" align="left" border="0"></a>
  Curtiss they increased the armament package to six fifty-caliber guns
and added a slightly more powerful engine to become the E model. Though
often outclassed by its adversaries in speed, maneuverability and rate
of climb, the P-40 earned a reputation in battle for extreme ruggedness.
 Warhawk was the name the USAAF adopted thus it is the official name of
the airplane series as a whole. For a low cost model of this historic
aircraft here is the Arii kit of the <a href="P40E.html">Curtiss P-40E Warhawk</a>. 7/16/05 <font color="#ff3300"> Construction completed 12/31/05 </font><br>
<br>

Approximately 1300 P-40K aircraft were manufactured at the Curtiss plant in Buffalo New York during the <a href="P40K.html"><img alt="" src="images/P40K/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="70"></a>
 latter half of 1942. At the time it was thought these would be the last
 P-40s made but delays in the P-60 program forced the continued
development of the type. Most of the K models went to China and India
but a few ended up in Africa and England to tangle with the
Messerschmitt Bf-109 while a few others went to Brazil and Russia. Let&#8217;s
 check out the latest offering from Hasegawa of what looks to be a
series of P-40 models, the <a href="P40K.html">Curtiss P-40K</a>. 4/4/06<br>
<br>

The Curtiss P-40 Warhawk was obsolete on the day it was introduced, at least by European standards that is. <a href="P40N.html" align="left"><img src="images/P40N/thumb.jpg" name="P40N" alt="P40N" align="left" border="0"></a>
Even so the type was used as a stop-gap measure in all theaters but by
1943 the technological gap was widening. Curtiss made a valiant attempt
to fix the issues with the Warhawk putting it into a stringent weight
reduction program which resulted in the fastest version of the aircraft
yet. AMT/ERTL provided the modeling community with a fine example of
this variant several years ago and it is still readily available. Let&#8217;s
take a look at the final production version of the Warhawk, the <a href="P40N.html">Curtiss P-40N</a>. 2/26/06 <font color="#ff3300">Second kit construction completed 12/30/06</font><br>

It&#8217;s the last of the line, the final version destined to never see production of an aircraft that fired the <a href="P40Q.html" align="left"><img src="images/P40Q/thumb.jpg" name="P40Q" alt="P40Q" align="left" border="0"></a>
 imagination of generations. The P-40 Warhawk, or better known as the
Flying Tiger, the type was not able to keep up with new designs being
produced during the war. Curtiss-Wright Corporation made one last effort
 to upgrade the aircraft and keep it competitive but it just wasn&#8217;t
enough. This is the Planet Models 1/48 scale full resin version of that
last effort, the <a href="P40Q.html">Curtiss XP-40Q-2</a>. 2/19/06 <font color="#ff3300"> Construction Completed 1/7/07</font><br>

This is a difficult aircraft to categorize, is it civilian or military? Nearly half of all produced <a href="Otter.html"><img alt="" src="images/Otter/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="82"></a>
 went to military service for utility and Search and Rescue operations.
In service around the world since 1952 and still highly sought after
today due to it&#8217;s ruggedness and reliability. Originally designated the
&#8216;King Beaver&#8217;, from Hobbycraft, this is the 1/48 scale De Havilland

The DC-3 set a new standard for air travel and made it possible for airlines to make a profit in <a href="C47.html"><img alt="" src="images/C47/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="83"></a> passenger service without government subsidies. Once the military got their hands on it, it became the C-47, which handled troops and equipment throughout the war. It continued in service right into the
21st century in both civilian and military arenas. For your consideration, this is the Monogram 1/48 scale <a href="C47.html">Douglas C-47</a> Skytrain.

Cargo hauler, soldier, movie star, this aircraft has certainly played a lot of roles during its lifespan. Developed <a href="AC119K.html"><img alt="" src="images/AC119K/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="78"></a> by Fairchild in 1947 to replace the aging C-82 Packet this new hauler was known as the Flying Boxcar in it&#8217;s civilian guise but was also known as &#8220;Spooky&#8221;, &#8220;Puff&#8221; or &#8220;Dragon Ship&#8221; while in military dress.

The original design was a biplane but after several design modifications it ultimately became know as the F4F &#8220;Wildcat&#8221;.  <a href="F4F.html" align="left"><img src="images/F4F/thumb.jpg" name="F4F" alt="F4F Wildcat" align="left" border="0"></a> As World War 2 raged the Wildcat's reputation and utilization grew immensely. The aircraft was seeing active service with the U.S. Navy and the Marines in not only the Pacific Theater but in North Africa as well. Grumman's stubby, rugged fighter held the line against the Zeros in the early air battles of the war. Tamiya offers a great foundation kit in 1/48 plus there is aftermarket stuff galore.

A contemporary of the famous Avro Lancaster bomber and the Short Stirling, the Handley Page Halifax was one of <a href="Halifax.html"><img alt="" src="images/Halifax/thumb.jpg" width="151" align="left" border="0" height="78"></a> three primary front line heavy bombers used by the British during the Second World War. Initially used as a day bomber the Halifax was found to be vulnerable to Luftwaffe fighters and was then restricted to night operations.

The Sea Fury did not fly until Feb. 21st, 1945 and production development would not allow the type to see action in the Second World War however it did see action during the Korean War. While not completely accurate Hobby Craft did manufacture a basic kit that could easily be built into a fine example of the <a href="SeaFury.html">Hawker Sea Fury F.B. Mk. II</a>. 6/16/07 <br>

The Hawker Typhoon was simply put the most effective ground attack aircraft used by the Western Allies in WW2. <a href="Typhoon.html"><img alt="" src="images/Typhoon/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="71"></a>
 For the Allies &#8220;Typhoon&#8221; was synonymous with ground attack. Designed by
 Hawker&#8217;s Sir Sidney Camm as a Hurricane/Spitfire replacement just
before WW2 the Typhoon was a large single seat fighter meant to be
faster and more heavily armed than anything that was in service with the
 RAF or any competing power. The Typhoon was lacking at heights over
15,000 feet, where most combat was fought but below that level it could
soundly beat the FW 190. From Hasegawa here is the 1/48 scale Hawker <a href="Typhoon.html">Typhoon Mk. 1B</a>.

She was a tank with wings. It was not uncommon to have reports of heavy rounds bouncing off the armored shell. She was an <a href="IL2M3.html"><img alt="" src="images/IL2M3/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="70"></a>
 Ilyushin IL-2. Designed in 1938 by Sergey Ilyushin all this aircraft&#8217;s
vital components including pilot were contained in an armored shell that
 comprised nearly 15% of the aircraft&#8217;s gross weight. She was slow but
she was tough, so tough that Germans on the ground called her &#8220;Flying

When the Russian Navy went looking to replace their outmoded recon
aircraft they went looking to T. M. Beriev and his design team. <a href="KOR1.html"><img alt="" src="images/KOR1/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="78"></a>
 They produced a classically designed seaplane that featured dual
controls and folding wings for shipboard storage. Intended to be
launched by catapult from battle ships and cruisers by time the war
broke out they were recalled from the navy, refitted with wheels and
used as coastal spotters and light strike aircraft under the new
designation BE-2. Step into the world of esoteric aircraft and look at

The Lavochkin La-5F was a development of the earlier La-5 which was based on the Lagg-3. Improvements incorporated into <a href="La5f.html"><img alt="" src="images/La5f/thumb.gif" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="71"></a>
 the F were better aerodynamic efficiency and improved flight controls.
The La-5F lost some of its punch in that one of the 20mm cannons was
dropped in a weight saving effort. Developmentally it was only an
interim aircraft but had a great effect in the air during the Great
Patriotic War. Vector, who is known for their excellent resin detail

The Lavochkin La-7 was considered one of the last &quot;Grand Pianos&quot; of combat aircraft, it was evolutionary <a href="La7.html"><img alt="" src="images/La7/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="87"></a>
 rather than revolutionary. The use of metals lightened the aircraft
considerably and combined with various other streamlining changes
resulted in an aircraft faster than the La-5 and more than a match for
the Luftwaffe&#8217;s Fw-190. The fifth offering from Gavia of the Czech

Design work began in 1936 on this butt-ugly dive bomber. It was intended to be a single seat aircraft with semi-retractable <a href="LN411.html"><img alt="" src="images/LN411/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="81"></a>
 landing gear with the primary user being the French Navy and the French

It seems slightly odd that we would have an American built reconnaissance bomber manufactured during the war years <a href="Maryland.html"><img alt="" src="images/Maryland/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="78"></a>
 that was not used by the United States Army Air Force but it&#8217;s true.
This is the Martin Maryland 167 that lost out in competition to the

When Luftwaffe pilots first sighted this sleek, high-speed aircraft in the skies over Russia they were not concerned. <a href="Mig3.html"><img alt="" src="images/Mig3/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="82"></a>
 They thought that they were German aircraft While the truth of the
matter rapidly became apparent to the Luftwaffe pilots, the German High
Command refused to believe the initial reports coming from the Eastern
Front. Now the Luftwaffe would have to contend with the high-speed,

The concept aircraft is the North American OV-10A Bronco and it performed with distinction as a replacement for the O-1 Bird Dog and O-2 Skymaster during the late '60s and '70s. Later the type performed well in civilian service.

The Flying Wing has such an aeronautically clean design that it gives it a big advantage over conventional <a href="N1M.html"><img alt="" src="images/N1M/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="71"></a>
 aircraft designs. The N-1M &#8220;Jeep&#8221; was truly the first American flying
wing aircraft. From its inception, it was plagued by poor performance
because it was both overweight and chronically underpowered. Despite
these problems it was successful enough to serve as the forerunner of
more advanced concepts such as the XB-35, YB-49 and the B-2 Stealth
Bomber. From Sword this is the 1/48 multi-media <a href="N1M.html">Northrop N-1M &#8220;Jeep&#8221;</a>. 9/17/04<br>

The OS2U Kingfisher came about as a result of a 1937 US Navy specification for a new &#8216;Observer-Scout&#8217; <a href="Kingfisher.html"><img alt="" src="images/Kingfisher/thumb.gif" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="79"></a>
 aircraft for use on battleships. Three companies offered up designs for
 the specification. The Vought airframe was selected and began a long
service history in the position. Monogram kitted this kit back in 1967
and it is the only 1/48 Kingfisher kit available. Come with me and see

The P-39 Airacobra had an unusual configuration by installing the engine behind the pilot, as close as <a href="P400.html"><img alt="" src="images/P400/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="62"></a>
 possible to the aircraft&#8217;s center of gravity. The Airacobra airframe
was streamlined and extremely aerodynamic but it did have a few
unpleasant flight characteristics. Hadley M. Dixon, WWII veteran and
P-39 pilot remembers thinking after he was introduced to the P-39:<em> &#8220;Its gender was feminine. Something that pretty just had to be a she.&#8221; </em> Let&#8217;s have a look at the Hasegawa rendering of the <a href="P400.html">P-39D/P-400 Airacobra</a>. 9/15/07 <br>

In the entire history of military aviation, there has never been an airplane that could match the P-47 <a href="TamiyaP47D.html"><img alt="" src="images/P47Dpics/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="69"></a>
 Thunderbolt for ruggedness and dependability. The pilots who flew it
into combat called it &quot;The Unbreakable&quot; and &quot;The plane that can do
anything.&quot; The Thunderbolt was surprisingly agile at high altitude but
could also drop like a brick, which was an advantage in air battles.
Luftwaffe pilots would find out that trying to break off combat and dive
 away was sheer suicide when fighting a &#8220;Jug&#8221;. Here is the Tamiya <a href="TamiyaP47D.html">P-47D</a> Bubble Top. 7/21/04<br>

 with any air force on earth with the single exception of its &quot;M&quot; model
sibling. The largest, heaviest and most powerful production version of
the Republic P-47, this birds innovative &#8216;wet wing&#8217; gave it an
incredible 2,350 mile range and the ability to escort B-29 bombers all

America&#8217;s first jet fighter&#8217;s performance was not spectacular and it never got into combat but the P-59 provided <a href="P59a.html"><img alt="" src="images/P59a/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="79"></a>
 training for AAF personnel and invaluable data for subsequent
development of higher performance jet airplanes. The P-59A project was
conducted under the utmost secrecy, with Bell building the airplane and
General Electric the engine. In the end, only 66 Airacomets were
constructed. Let&#8217;s take a look at the Hobbycraft offering of the Bell <a href="P59a.html">P-59A Airacomet</a>. 4/3/05<br>

In response to basic requirements and specifications handed down by the Emmons Board, Northrop <a href="P61.html"><img alt="" src="images/F15/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="77"></a>
 developed a large twin engine, twin boomed aircraft to house the
British developed Airborne Interception RADAR unit in the nose. This was
 the birth of the &#8216;Black Widow&#8217;. The P-61 &#8216;Black Widow&#8217; operated with
distinction in both the Pacific and the European theaters. Today there
are four surviving P-61s, none of which are in flyable condition. Here

The Russian heavy bomber program began life in 1934 as the ANT-42 and by December of 1936 a prototype was flying. <a href="PE8.html"><img alt="" src="images/PE8/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="82"></a>
 It was renamed the Pe-8 and was of equal performance and capacity to
the American B-17 bomber. It had an operational ceiling in excess of
30,000 feet, a maximum speed of about 276 mph and could carry 8,800
pound of bombs. Russian manufacture kits are growing in both quality and
 popularity recently and this Amodel kit is a good example of what is

The concept of the I-16 began in the very early 1930s when Nikolai Nikolaevich Polikarpov was working on <a href="I16t29.html"><img alt="" src="images/I16t29/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="81"></a>
 the I-15 Bi-plane. The Type 29 was the final incarnation of the
aircraft design with a Shvetsov M-63 engine and a single 12.7mm machine
gun. Eduard has been producing fine 1/48 scale kits of several of the

One of the most widely recognizable aircraft from World War Two has got to be the Supermarine Spitfire. This aircraft <a href="Seafire.html"><img alt="" src="images/Seafirepics/thumb.jpg" width="120" align="left" border="0" height="74"></a>
 experienced a long evolution resulting in many refinements and

 later adopted by the RAF as its front line defense fighter, developed
and modified over several years it was more than a legend, it was the
Spitfire. By the end of the war it was up to the Mk.16 but development
continued to the ultimate Mk.22/24 Spitfire before it was put out to
pasture by the introduction of the jet fighter. Originally kitted by
Airfix, now Eduard has taken this and upgraded it to a &#8220;full meal deal&#8221;

 same stables as the elegant Spitfire. Initially ordered by the Royal
Australian Air Force in 1935 as the Seagull V it entered service with
Britain's Fleet Air Arm in 1936 as the Walrus. To its crews, however, it
 was widely known as the Shagbat. Despite its appearance it established a
 solid reputation for reliability and ability to withstand damage. From

 Service Command is the XP-55 Ascender, a tail-first, pusher fighter.
The performance of the XP-55 was not very impressive and was in fact
inferior to that of the more conventional fighters already in service.
Had the aircraft been fitted with the originally intended engine and had
 fly-by-wire systems been available at the time, it most likely would
have been a successful design. Ultimately, it simply became another

 Circular Proposal R-40C. The XP-56 was the first USAAF fighter aircraft
 to be built by Jack Northrop&#8217;s third attempt at an independent aircraft
 company, Northrop Aircraft Inc. of Hawthorne, California, the
forerunner of today's Northrop Corporation. Ultimately it failed to
perform anywhere near the desired level but did provide data that
contributed to the B-2 bomber and the development of new construction
processes. Let&#8217;s take a look at Czech Model&#8217;s 1/48 multi-media <a href="XP56.html">Northrop XP-56</a> &#8220;Black Bullet&#8221;. 1/21/05<br>

 The designed showed good promise and was developed into the armed
advanced trainer version, Yak-7A. Improvements continued, leading to the
 introduction of the &quot;Yak-7B&quot; in the spring of 1942 with improved
armament and engine. The Yak-7B was used with great effectiveness by
