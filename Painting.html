<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the variety of Luftwaffe interior colors used, it is difficult to keep track of what goes where and when. In an effort to assist the scale modeler, we will look at these color selections in two sections, the first dealing with cockpits, and the second focusing on wheel wells, engine compartments, etc. While this is not meant to be the definitive guide on the subject, you should find it to be a reasonably accurate and useful guide.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as paints go, you’ll find several slight variances in shade and tone as you go from manufacture to manufacture. I prefer to use RLM paints from Gunze-Sangyo, Tamiya and Polly Scale. Generally for other interior colors like the reds and yellows I’ll resort to the Testors enamel lines.
<br>
<br><b>PART 1-- COCKPITS 
<br>
<br></b>       Reichsluftministrium (RLM) regulations state that prior to November 1941, 
cockpits/crew areas were to be RLM Green-Gray 02, with the exception of instrument 
panels, which were Gray with black instrument faces. After November 1941, all 
cockpit/crew areas visible through the glazing (windows) were to be RLM Black-Gray 
66. Instrument panels remained as previously stated. Fuel lines were yellow, oil 
lines were brown, coolant lines were green, oxygen lines were blue and fire extinguisher 
lines were red. Here is a general guide of specific aircraft by type arraigned 
alphabetically. Keep in mind that with any military regulation, variations of 
implementation and interpretation were often seen.

<br>
<br><b>PART 2 -- WHEEL WELLS, ENGINE COMPARTMENTS, ETC... 
<br>
<br></b>       Regulations for these interior areas were standardized, and not a lot 
of variation existed, except for late war fighter aircraft. This variance in the 
latter stage of the war was caused by a number of factors. One was due to the 
allied strategic bombing campaign, which caused production of aircraft to be decentralized, 
leading to differences depending on the subcontractor of the specific components. 
Another was the urgent need for fighters, and the haste with which they were produced, 
which caused some relaxation of compliance with official regulations in order 
to speed up production. Another consideration was the remanufacturing of aircraft, 
in which case whole assemblies were pre-painted at the same time. Where variations 
are documented, they will appear listing the type of aircraft they were seen on. 
Remember, this is a general guide, and your best verification will be your own 
reference material. 
<br>
<br><b>Engine Compartments </b>
<br>
<br>       The interior of engine compartments were painted in RLM 02, with the exception 
of the firewall. This was painted RLM 02 on the cockpit side, but left unpainted 
on the engine side in most cases. All engine support braces, connecting rods and 
internal framework was also RLM 02. Pipelines for fuel, oil and coolant remained 
unpainted outside of the cockpit areas. Engines remained in the color applied 
by the manufacturer, usually black. 
<br>
<br><b>Exceptions 
<br>
<br></b>       Photos of some Bf-109F/G/K's exist which show the interior of the cowling 
in natural metal, while most are RLM 02. Photos of some Fw-190D-9's and Ta-152's 
show the interior of the cowling in natural metal, while most are RLM 02. Photos 
of some Me-262 and He-162 nacelles indicate that the interior was left in natural 
metal. These are all late war production aircraft and these variances are most 
likely a result of production dispersal and supply problems. 
<br>
<br><b>Fuselage 
<br>
<br></b>       Prior to fall 1942, aircraft fuselage areas, with the exception of the 
cockpit were finished in RI.M 02. After fall 1942, they were left unpainted. The 
Alcad used for aircraft skinning material, had electroplated finish to prevent 
corrosion, which gave it a golden sheen, similar to that on the interior of soup 
cans. Aluminum and other alloy areas were still given a coat of RLM 02 to prevent 
corrosion. However, galvanized steel was left unpainted. Equipment such as radios, 
fuel tanks, oxygen bottles, etc. were in the color applied by the manufacturer. 
Radios were usually black or gray; fuel tanks were usually black or gray. Oxygen 
bottles were usually overall blue, or painted with blue stripping. <b>
<br>
<br>Exceptions 
<br>
<br></b>       Repaired areas were usually painted with whatever paint stocks were available, 
or left unpainted. 
<br>
<br><b>Wing 
<br>
<br></b>       As with the fuselage, prior to fall 1942, wing areas were finished in 
RLM 02. After fall 1942, with the exception of the wheel wells and flap areas, 
they were left unpainted. . Gun bay areas generally retained their RLM 02 paint. 
They exhibited the golden color of the Alcad skinning material. Aluminum and other 
alloy areas were still given a coat of RLM 02 to prevent corrosion. However, galvanized 
steel was left unpainted. Equipment such as guns, fuel tanks, oxygen bottles, 
etc. were in the color applied by the manufacturer. Guns were usually black or 
gray; fuel tanks were usually black or gray. Oxygen bottles were usually overall 
blue, or painted with blue stripping. 
<br>
<br><b>Exceptions 
<br>
<br></b>       Repaired areas were usually painted with whatever paint stocks were available, 
or left unpainted. Gun bays on late war aircraft were sometimes seen in natural 
metal. 
<br>
<br><b>Flap Areas 
<br>
<br></b>       For aircraft without separate flaps, the flap `well' and interior of the 
flap was painted with RLM 02. This is also true of the radiator flap and cowl 
flap areas. 
<br>
<br><b>Exceptions 
<br>
<br></b>       Bf-109B/C/D/E's usually had the underwing radiator area painted the same 
color as the fuselage underside. Some late war Fw-190's exhibited natural metal 
flap areas. 
<br>
<br><b>Wheel wells 
<br>
<br></b>       Now for the area you've been waiting for. Few regulations specific to 
the wheel well area exist, company and factories instructions usually deciding 
the matter. In keeping with standard practices as identified above, wheel wells 
and components should have been RLM 02. This includes tail wheel and nose wheel 
areas. Main gear and nose wheel struts were painted RLM 02, with the exception 
of the polished steel oleo area. Shock absorbers were a very dark gray, again 
with the exception of the polished steel telescopic sections. Cast and stamped 
wheel hubs were painted in semi-gloss black. Tail wheel hubs were usually unpainted 
(dark gray), or painted the underside color. 
<br>
<br><b>Exceptions 
<br>
<br></b>       Some aircraft that used 100-octane fuel had the starboard gear strut (and 
sometimes the cover as well) painted red to distinguish them from other aircraft. 

<br>
<br>Photos of Bf-109B/C/D/E/F's occasionally show wheel wells painted the same color 
as the underside. 
<br>Photos of Bf-109G/K's indicate the wheel wells and struts were usually RLM 76 
(fuselage underside color). 
<br>Photos of some Bf-109's show main gear struts painted RLM 66. 
<br>Photos of some Bf-109's show main gear struts painted underside color. 
<br>Photos of some Fw-190A-4 and later show wheel wells painted underside color. 

<br>Photos of some late war Fw-190's show natural metal wheel wells. </div>
<div>
<br>       Me-262's had main gear bay/cockpit tub underside left in natural metal. 
However, nose wheel bay and strut were painted RLM 02. Some Me-262's had the main 
wheel well and/or nose wheel bay painted RLM 76. 
<br>
<br><b>Propellers 
<br>
<br></b>       Although not an interior area, propellers are also included in the Reichsluftministrium 
regulations. Steel prop blades were painted RLM 70 black green, while wood blades 
were painted RLM 71 dark green, with a semi gloss clear coat protectant. Other 
late war wooden prop blades were painted in blue-gray, with the same semi gloss 
clear coat protectant. 
<br>       So there you have it, a fairly complete breakdown of World War 2 Luftwaffe 
color directives. While the information provided is by no means the definitive 
source on this subject, it should be a useful general guide. Remember, your best 
source of information is specific photos of your modeling subject! </div>
