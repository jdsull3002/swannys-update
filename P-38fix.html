&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About five years ago I started working on an Academy P-38. Things were going along just great, the cockpit looked great, parts seemed to be fitting well and I had some great aftermarket decals I was going to use. Once the base kit was together and I started painting I noticed the rudders were twisted off center. I&#8217;m like &#8216;what the heck?&#8217;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that I had not been paying close enough attention when I glued the booms together. I thought I had but I guess it was not good enough. I chalked this one up to experience and placed the unfinished model in the parts graveyard. At least I still had the cool aftermarket decals and could try this kit again sometime in the future. What I did not know at the time was I was not alone with this problem. Seems quite a few modelers are challenged by P-38 tail boom alignment, especially with the Academy kit. Now there is hope for all of us unsatisfied P-38 builders and that hope comes in the form of Paul Budzik and his ingenious P-38 construction jig.

Fixing the P-38 Tail Booms

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been in the process of building a replacement P-38 for my ceiling air force&#8217;s aging Monogram version that I built years before there was anything else in 1/48. I&#8217;m using the Academy kit and I&#8217;ve become aware of the difficulty in getting the assembly straight and square. Nothing spoils a nice P-38 model worse than something being cockeyed and it&#8217;s very easy to do. I came up with a method that worked pretty well so I thought it might be of interest to some others. I&#8217;m building for wheels up so of course if you&#8217;re doing gear down then there will be a few differences. First off, I rubber-banded the aft section of the booms to maintain a reasonable alignment, and just cemented the top and bottom of the forward section of each engine paying strict attention to their alignment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This photo shows the warpage/discrepancy in the area of the vertical stabilizer. The difficulty arises trying to insure that it matches the vertical alignment of the engine nacelle.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a small notch in the front of the nacelle at the joint to accept a piece of .010 sheet brass.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boom was then jigged up like this. The jig consists of nothing more that two blocks of wood at either end that are rubber-banded around a plywood base. The rest of the boom was cemented.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the cement had set, I fitted the doors and cemented them in place while the boom was still in the jig.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also added a piece of sheet styrene for added rigidity. This was also done while the boom was in the jig.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step in mating the booms to the wings was to make sure everything was square when viewed from above. The nacelles rest against a straight stop forward and the booms are aligned with the wings. The horizontal stabilizer rest on a block so that it remains horizontal. A square is used to insure that the vertical stabilizers are vertical. The horizontal stabilizer is glued up first.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the glue is thoroughly set, any final touch-up adjustments are made to improve the fit and alignment of the wing to boom joint. Finally this joint is taped and then glued.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found the process a bit counterintuitive, cementing the horizontal stabilizer first, but it worked like a charm. I hope it helps some modelers.
