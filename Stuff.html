In 1939 Italian armor manufactures began development of the Autoblinda, Italy's armored car. Initially these were armed with various machine guns <a href="Autoblinda.html" onMouseOver="document.Autoblinda.src='images/Autoblinda/thumb1.jpg'" align="left"

But by 1942 they had determined that a combination of 20mm cannon and 8mm machine gun worked best. This was manufactured as the AB 41 version and was the most commonly used Italian armored car. It was used by Italian reconnaissance units in the Western Desert and Tunisia, in the Balkans and by Colonial Police.

Well it had to happen eventually. I have been considering the idea of a modeling forum for some time now <A HREF="http://swannysmodels.com/yabb/YaBB.pl"; target="_new" rel="nofollow"><img border="0" src="images/Buttons/forumthumb.jpg" align="left" width="120" height="75"></A> and have finally gone and done it. While you may see mostly aircraft on the main site this forum is dedicated to all forms of modeling. You are invited to come join the party; registration is quick, easy and painless. This is the perfect place to ask other modelers for their help or opinions, to help others just beginning the adventure and to show off some of your work to folks who can appreciate it. <a href="http://swannysmodels.com/yabb/YaBB.pl" target="_new" rel="nofollow">Swanny's Models Forum</a>. 7/25/06

Okay, so this is not an aircraft but if you were to look closely enough on any Luftwaffe airfield you could <A HREF="Hanomag.html"; return true"  OnMouseOver="window.status='Hanomag SS-100'; return true"><img border="0" src="images/Hanomag/thumb.jpg" align="left" width="120" height="77"></A> probably find one parked off in a corner somewhere. And if you are an older modeler like myself, you might have even seen one of these parked behind the traveling carnival when you were a kid. Developed in 1936 as a civilian heavy agricultural tractor this Hanomag vehicle became one of the most common Luftwaffe airfield tractors and was most remembered for its use with the V-2 missile. Let's take a look at Matador Models <A HREF="Hanomag.html" OnMouseOut="window.status=''; return true"  OnMouseOver="window.status='Hanomag SS-100'; return true">Hanomag SS-100</A> heavy road tractor. 12/31/04 <font color="#ff3300"> Construction completed 1/3/05 </font>
