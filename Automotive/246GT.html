        <h2>
            Developmental Background
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Dino nametag at Ferrari is intended to honor Enzo Ferrari's son,
            Dino, who is credited with designing the V-6 engine. Dino and engineer Vittorio Jano were instrumental in
            influencing Enzo to produce a series of race cars in the 1950's and 1960's using the V-8 and V-6
            engines. The Dino of course was the V-6 powered version. The Dino was markets as an 'almost Ferrari'
            intended to be an economical competitor of the Porsche 911. Dino lost his battle with MS in 1956 before the
            Ferrari
            Dino was completed and never got to see his V-6 engine in production.
            <BR>
        </p>
        <p> In 1969 the 246GT entered the market with mid-mount 195bhp V-6 engine and a top
            speed of 148mph. Over the next two years there were a few slight modifications in ignition systems and body
            materials but overall the car was mostly unchanged. The 246GT and GTS were produced through 1974. In 1973
            the
            Ferarri 308 was introduced which also carried the Dino nametag however it sported a 230 bhp V-8 and had a
            much
            different profile than the 246 and earlier 206. The 246 was simply a great looking car with excellent
            performance
            and reasonable fuel economy, definitely a fearsome competitor for the Porsche 911 and priced to match.
            Personally I
            feel the only weak point on the 246 was the heating system, in cold climates your feet were going to freeze.

        <h2> The Kit</h2>

        <p> Way back when I had much more hair and much less waist line I purchased my
            first sports car, a 1970 Opel GT, the Baby Vette. It was at that time I decided my next car was going to
            have to be
            the 1972 Dino 246. Well, that dream never did come true and my next sports car was a Porsche but the 246
            still
            captures my attention. A few years ago while at a local IPMS club kit auction this Fujimi kit came up and I
            was able
            to satisfy that old dream to a very small degree by stomping out all other bidders and taking this baby
            home. Only
            kit I bought that day that was not an airplane. Today I still see this kit showing up on E-Bay but with red
            box art,
            same kit just different artwork.</p>

        <p> The simple act of opening the box and taking a quick look at the parts trees is
            enough to get the heart beat to accelerate just a little, this is a well detailed package. The multi-part
            body shot
            in white plastic is bagged separately and in nearly immaculate condition. There are a few very fine mold
            separation
            seams along the tops of the fenders and along the edges of the roof line that need to be sanded off but
            these are
            almost invisible at this point &#8211; an item that is very easily taken care of. The vinyl tires are
            preplaced on
            the chromed rims and bagged separately with individual knock-offs and attachment screws, a medium sprue of
            chrome
            exterior detail pieces is included along with a small sprue of white parts mostly associated with body
            hatches. A
            medium sprue of clear parts covers all the cockpit glass and various light lenses along with a display stand
            for the
            engine and a ID plate for the car. These parts are well cast with excellent clarity.

        <p> We get four sprues of medium gray injection molded parts that cover all the
            running gear, engine components and cabin parts. Mold separation seams vary from nearly nonexistent to
            medium on
            these parts and are easily shaved off with the flat edge of a razor knife. I did find a very few pieces with
            minimal
            flash on them and no evidence of sink marks anywhere within the kit. All parts fit together very well and
            once
            assembled presents the modeler with a very well detailed piece of art. Taking inventory of all the parts we
            have:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>24 exterior chrome detail pieces not including rims.</li>
            <li> 5 chrome rims and 5 chrome knock-offs.</li>
            <li>5 vinyl tires and 4 attachment screws.</li>
            <li>21 clear parts.</li>
            <li>6 primary body panels.</li>
            <li>15 additional parts in white polystyrene.</li>
            <li>150 medium gray parts on four trees.</li>
            <li>Total parts count = 235 parts of which only one or two may not be used.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Decals and instructions</h2>
        <p>Kit instructions consist of an eight panel A-4 fold-out sheet. Almost all the text is in Japanese with only a
           few lines of English scattered through them. The historical background section on the car is completely in
           Japanese while general performance specifications have English subtitles. There is a complete parts maps
           included and a partial paint chart, by partial I mean it only covers exterior colors.
            <img alt="" src="images/Ferrari/decals.jpg"
                width="242"
                height="256"
            >
           If you want to figure out what the interior color call-outs are you&#8217;ll need to reference possibly a
           Gunze paint code chart &#8211; most of it is pretty easy to figure out and a few quick internet searches
           will answer most questions on color.</p>

        <p>There are eighteen exploded view assembly steps and every one of them
           includes a sub-view showing more detailed parts assembly, in some cases multiple viewing angles to assist
           the
           modeler in getting things lined up correctly. There are color call-outs throughout these steps however most
           of them
           do not relate back to the paint code chart so it&#8217;s back to the internet for research.</p>

        <p>The kit includes a single small sheet of decals. Here we have a couple of
           license plate options, various manufacture logo plates and identification plates. Instrument panel details
           are
           provided here and while they look good on the sheet, once on the model it is quickly apparent that the print
           registry is slightly off. Overall color density is good and when decals are placed with a drop of Future
           floor
           polish they snuggle right down with no evidence of silvering.</p>

        <h2> Construction</h2>
        <p>The engine captured my interest first so construction began there. For the most part I worked with Alclad
           paints here using aluminum for the block, heads and various components with Jet Exhaust for the manifolds.
           Some
            <img alt="" src="images/Ferrari/engine1sm.jpg"
                 width="147"
                 height="125"
                 data-link="images/Ferrari/engine1.jpg">

            <img alt="" src="images/Ferrari/engine2sm.jpg"
                 width="133"
                 height="125"
                 data-link="images/Ferrari/engine2.jpg">
           Testors flat black and flat red offer some tonal variations here. I used some metallic red magnet wire to
           create the ignition harness and placed a couple decal identification plates on the engine with Future as a
           setting agent. The decals blend in so well as to be nearly invisible. Some judicious black sludge wash
           was applied in a few areas and the engine was ready for installation.</p>

        <p>Since I now have an engine I guess it would be a good idea to get the chassis ready to accept it. Other than
           some aluminum wheels and gold brake calipers there is not much color definition down here so I tried to break
           things up by using some magnesium, steel and dark aluminum in various places to add accent. Those rear coil
           springs are actually solid pieces of plastic that are simply painted with Alclad magnesium and washed with
           black sludge wash - they came out pretty convincing for so little effort. The trickiest part so far is the
           placement of the exhaust manifolds. These things have to be just right or the muffler will not fit nor will
           the aft deck. I was off just a little and had to grind a notch in the aft deck with my Dremel and stretch a
           piece of exhaust pipe to make my final connections. Sadly I have no advice to give to help avoid this
           situation to help you out should you be working this same project.</p>

        <p>Pay attention when assembling the wheel hubs, you don't want to get any glue on part #D5 during assembly.
           This needs to rotate freely within the assembly. When the wheel and tire are screwed in place those little
           studs on the face of D5 provide a lock point so you can torque the screw down. I didn't figure this out until
           the last minute - maybe I'm a little slow or maybe I just build too many airplanes. I added more magnet wire
           on the cooling fans and the battery just to help dress up those items.</p>

        <p>
            All that is left to deal with on the chassis is the main cabin. Before starting this section I had to decide
            what exterior color I would be painting the car as we are now dealing with the customer optional areas. I
            did not want to use the standard signal yellow that is so popular with the French and is shown on this
            Boxart and felt that the red seen on the newer releases was also overused. I went to the Ferarri website and
            took a look at options that are customarily available on their cars. From here I selected a light tan
            leather interior to be combined with a deep metallic blue exterior. Okay, not a classic Ferarri color
            combination but still possible and something that would break up the automotive colors on my display shelf.
            <img alt="" src="images/Ferrari/chassis7sm.jpg"
                 width="192"

                 width="281"

                 data-link="images/Ferrari/chassis6.jpg">
        </p>
        <p>Seatbelts were fashioned from strips of tan masking tape cut 2.5mm wide
           and attached to the hardware with spots of superglue. The hardware itself is provided as gray plastic parts
           which I
           painted gloss black then hit with some polished Alclad aluminum. Looking at the instrument panel you can see
           a
           slight sliver of white around each of the instrument dials; this is a result of the decal print registry
           being
           slightly off the mark. I guess for the time period it is not bad but by today's standards I would expect
           better,
           maybe I am too picky. Now that the cabin is complete I can start working on the body shell.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="update">Construction Update 3/20/11</h2>

        <p>
            Okay, it&#8217;s time to get busy with the body. After scraping all the mold separation seams on the body
            and really there were not many but I was looking for as smooth a finish as possible, I wet sanded things
            with superfine sandpaper and wiped everything down. The interior cabin was masked off and the body, with all
            hatches taped in place, was shot with Alclad Pale Gold. As with any primer this made any minor defects show
            up quite easily and after they were repaired the body got two more coats of Pale Gold and was allowed to
            cure overnight.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next day I dusted the body with compressed air to remove any dust or lint that may have found its way
            there and prepared for the first coat of Alclad Transparent Blue. I must have put down five or six coats
            before I had the color density I was looking for then the car went under a box top to cure for the night.
            The box top was just to act as a dust shield. After curing the body was coated with Future floor finish cut
            30% with Simple Green. This provides a very <I>wet</I> look when dry. Now the masks are removed and the
            clear parts installed. I was presented with a problem getting the shoulder
            harnesses to lay down with the cabin sealed up so elected to remove the driver&#8217;s side window and just
            leave it open. This way I could reach in with a pick and place the shoulder belts. I could have stuck the
            remaining piece of clear for that window to a tacky probe and installed it but decided to just leave it as
            is. Now the body can be placed on the chassis.
        </p>

        <p>
            Putting this thing on the chassis was no easy taks. The nose has to slip into the body shell, the sides need
            to flex out and the rear needs to slip into the body shell &#8211; a nearly impossible combination of
            actions. With the judicious use of several flat jeweler&#8217;s screw drivers as pry bars I finally got
            everything to snap in place without causing any damaged &#8211; amazed myself. Next the chrome parts get
            placed mostly using medium superglue and accelerator to prevent fogging. After the chrome parts were done
            and all fingerprints removed with a dust cloth I applied two more coats of Future/Simple Green with a wide
            soft brush and placed the car back under the dust shield for its final cure.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall this was a fun build, for the most part everything fit together very
            well and the quality of the parts was good. At some points I found the instructions to be vague and the modeler
            really needs to spend some time studying these things and test fitting parts, especially those parts that will move
            when the model is complete. This makes a great addition to my slowly growing model car collection.
