&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had wanted to have these sets ready for you back in mid-November but things happened. We had problems sourcing the crystal packs for the larger sets and then the production guy's wife had a baby right in the middle of the whole run and let me tell you childbirth can derail a program like nothing else. So please, accept my apologies for the tardiness of this release. What we have here for you are all the previously released DVD sets in hi-def with the addition of a 4-volume set with a discount price. This is a limited release. I did not order enormous quantities of these DVDs so do not dilly-dally, once they are gone ..... That's it, nothing more until <I>maybe</I> next Christmas.

Swanny's Models is proud to announce the release of the first in a series of instructional modeling DVDs. <A HREF="Products/DVD.html" ; return true" OnMouseOver="window.status='DVD'; return true"><img border="0" src="images/DVD/thumb.jpg" align="left" width="64" height="84"></A> This DVD will take the modeler from the first parts preparation steps all the way through decaling and basic weathering. The primary purpose of this video is to assist the new modeler in achieving good results early. You can follow this link for more information on the video and ordering information. <A HREF="Products/DVD.html" OnMouseOut="window.status=''; return true" OnMouseOver="window.status='DVD'; return true">Basic Model Building Skills</A> & the P-40K. 12/20/06

Volume Two from Swanny's Models takes you through the complete process of building and detailing a resin aircraft cockpit. All steps are covered from initial washing to pour stub removal, painting and assembling a quality resin cockpit. Next the modeler goes through a similar process with a photo etched cockpit. Here the process of annealing the frets are covered along with how to remove parts without immediately losing them. Swanny shows you how to paint and assemble an acetate instrument panel and how to attach small PE detail pieces. In addition to all this the video set includes a bonus segment on working with vacuform canopies and there is more! <A HREF="Products/DVD2.html" OnMouseOut="window.status=''; return true" OnMouseOver="window.status='DVD2'; return true">Advanced Modeling Skills: Resin & PE cockpits.

<p><img alt="" src="images/Dragonfly/cover1.jpg" width="400" align="left" border="0" height="300">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember the first model that I built. My father gave me a
Revell submarine kit for my birthday in 1969. I clearly recall the two
of us sitting at the dining room table with one of those orange tubes of
 Testors cement putting that thing together. It was an excellent bathtub
 toy for many years. Prior to that my older brother had entertained my
sister and myself with aerial operas involving a 1/48 scale Monogram SBD
 Dauntless and a Monogram Corsair - I still have those two planes, dusty
 and worn but laden with memories that can never be replaced.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many times while shopping e-bay I've wondered what a particular
kit consisted of or how good the detail of casting was or even if a
particular kit had raised or recessed panel lines but could not answer
these questions until I actually opened the box. While surfing various
forums I would see common questions asked many times by modelers just
beginning the polystyrene adventure, looking for clues to decaling,
weathering and detailing. This site is dedicated to answering some of
those questions. While I do not consider myself to be an exceptionally
skilled modeler, I have picked up a few tricks over the last thirty
years of modeling and will share them with you. Included here are full
build reviews, in box kit reviews, construction tips and gallery photos
of kits I have built. Most of these are 1/48th scale World War 2
aircraft. Also included here are a variety of links to on-line modeling
forums, review sites, internet hobby shops, aviation art sites and real
aircraft reference sites.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This site is a work in progress. I hope that you find it as enjoyable as I have. <br>

Once the war ended resources could be devoted to these tasks. The 1947/8 model year Commodore from Hudson Motor Company introduced a 'step-down' which combined a uni-body floor pan structure with a recessed frame. This combined with a NASCAR style straight six grew into the Hudson Hornet which saw production for several years. Here we see the epitome of that production series, the <A HREF="Hudson.html"OnMouseOut="window.status=''; return true" OnMouseOver="window.status='Hudson Hornet'; return true">1953 Hudson Hornet</A>. 4/29/2012 <font color="#ff3300"> Construction update 08/31/2015 </font>

The trucking and rail industries created transport trailers both enclosed and open double deck units to fill this need. For the entire first half of 2015 this kit was listed as a future release from Revell with actual release date pushed back more than once. By June 1, 2015 it had finally hit store shelves with the manufacture hype being that it was all new tooling and new decals.
